The file SortingAlgoPerformanceChecker.java contains the code to check the performance of the various sorting techniques.


I have also included the snapshots for some of the results in the directory Output_Snapshots. 
The array size I took was 20.  And I have checked it for -- 
	1. Random Order of the elements in the array.
	2. Almost Order of the elements in the array. 80% of the elements in the array are already sorted.
	3. Reverse Order of the elements in the array.
	4. In Order of the elements in the array.
